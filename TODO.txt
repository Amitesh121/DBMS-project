Code to run:
g++ main.cpp ./class/user/user.cpp ./class/database.cpp ./class/column.cpp ./class/table.cpp -o prog



Note: I've assumed that Table Names are unique right now
Alright it took about 30 mins just to get things working since the errors were pretty huge.

TODO:
so i'm thinking to create a MFile class that will hold the file, while the user is interacting with it 
i dont think it would be difficult to implement so try to work on it and try to ensure that the code atleast 
compiles.

Aim for MFile: 
    1. It would be good and faster if we keep the file with our hold while the user is
        interacting with the table as it would be much faster then loading it every time.
    2. create functions that include :: addRow, editCell, and for sending data to tables and column

I'm not sure if we would be holding the file while user is interacting but its good if we have as much abstraction 
as possible since we gonna implement many functions later

happy coding guys :)
